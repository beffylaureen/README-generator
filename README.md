# README Generator

## This project involved generating a README.md file from the terminal using NodeJS, the inquire module, and other node modules.  

## When the application is launched in the bash terminal with "node index.js," a series of questions displays for the user to answer.  Once all questions have been answered, a READMD.md file is generated in the results folder.
